        <h2>Rohan Niroula - about me</h2>
        
        <p>
            Greetings! My name is Rohan Niroula, and I come from the beautiful region of Jhapa in Nepal. Currently a diligent student in grade nine at Vidya Niketan Secondary School, I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of web development. While my formal training in HTML spans just a week, I've quickly developed a strong affinity for coding and designing websites. I'm passionate about creating visually compelling and user-friendly interfaces, and I'm actively expanding my skills in CSS and JavaScript to bring more dynamic elements to my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I find joy in both indoor and outdoor games, which serve as a delightful contrast to my technical pursuits. In my free time, I also enjoy exploring the scenic landscapes of Nepal and indulging in its rich cultural heritage. My upbringing in Jhapa has instilled in me a deep appreciation for community and diversity, shaping my values and outlook on life.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a thirst for knowledge and a commitment to excellence, I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation. I aspire to make meaningful contributions in the field of web development, leveraging technology to create impactful solutions. Thank you for visiting my website and joining me on this exciting journey of learning and discovery!
