            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <small><b>
                <p>In the realm of programming, I immerse myself in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating websites and applications that seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetic appeal. With each project, whether it's a personal website or a dynamic web application, I aim to refine my coding skills and explore new technologies. Programming allows me to translate ideas into tangible digital solutions, fostering problem-solving abilities and sparking my creativity through innovative design and user experience.</p>

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <small><b>
                <p>Drawing is my creative outlet where I wield pencils and digital tools to capture intricate details and evoke emotions on paper or screen. From portraits to landscapes, I explore various techniques and styles, refining my ability to convey depth and expression in every stroke. It's a meditative process where I find joy in bringing imaginations to life, honing my skills through constant practice and seeking inspiration from both nature and artistic influences.</p>

            <h3>Making Games</h3>
            <small><b>
                <p>Game development merges my passion for programming with creative storytelling and interactive design. Through coding and game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, I craft immersive worlds and engaging gameplay experiences. From concept to execution, I enjoy tackling challenges like game mechanics and level design, aiming to create memorable experiences that captivate players. Each project teaches me valuable lessons in project management, teamwork, and the art of balancing fun and functionality in game development.</p>

            <h3>Listening to Songs</h3>
            <small><b>
                <p>Music is my constant companion, enriching every moment with its melodies and lyrics that resonate with emotions and experiences. From upbeat rhythms to soulful ballads, I explore diverse genres and discover new artists, finding inspiration and solace in the power of music. Whether it's discovering a new favorite song or revisiting timeless classics, music fuels my creativity and serves as a soundtrack to my daily life, enhancing moments of reflection, motivation, and joy.</p>

            <h3>Learning New Skills</h3>
            <small><b>
                <p>Embracing a growth mindset, I dedicate time to learning beyond programming, exploring a wide range of interests and skills. From mastering new languages to delving into photography, cooking, or even martial arts, each skill acquired broadens my perspective and enriches my life journey. Learning is a continuous adventure where I challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone, fostering resilience, adaptability, and a deeper appreciation for lifelong learning.</p>
